#
# File:    prodsingle_sbnd.fcl
# Purpose: Produce single muon events including full SBND detector simulation
# Version: 1.1
# 
# This configuration runs event generation, simulation of propagation through
# matter and readout simulation.
# 
# Input: no input file required
# 
# Dependencies:
# - uses the bundle of SBND simulation services
#
# Changes:
# 20160601 (petrillo@fnal.gov) [v1.1]
#   - added inline documentation
#   - moved service configuration from services.user (deprecated) to services
#   - changed Timing module (deprecated) with TimeTracker
#   - added MemoryTracker module
#   - tuned message facility configuration
#
